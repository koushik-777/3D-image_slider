A visually appealing 3D rotating image carousel built with pure HTML and CSS. This project creates an immersive image viewing experience with a Spider-Man themed background and automatically rotating image slides.

## Preview

Add screenshots or GIFs of your project here to showcase the 3D slider effect.

## Features

- **3D Rotating Image Carousel** with 10 image slots
- **Automatic Rotation Animation** for seamless transitions
- **Responsive Design** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Custom Background** with a Spider-Man theme and blur effect
- **Stylish Author Information Section**
- **Social Media Links** to showcase your profiles

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the slider
- **CSS3** for animations and 3D transforms
- **Google Fonts** (ICA Rubrik Black and Poppins) for typography

## How It Works

The slider uses **CSS 3D transforms and perspective** to create a carousel effect:

- **CSS Variables** (`--quantity` and `--position`) determine the number of slides and their position
- **`rotateY` Transform** positions each image around a circular path
- **`@keyframes autoRun`** creates the continuous rotation animation
- **Media Queries** ensure the slider looks good on all devices

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-image-slider.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   cd 3d-image-slider
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- Replace the default images in the `images` folder with your own.
- Customize the **CSS variables** in `styles.css` to tweak the animation speed, size, or appearance.
