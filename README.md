How It Works
The slider uses CSS 3D transforms and perspective to create a carousel effect:

CSS variables (--quantity and --position) determine the number of slides and their position
The rotateY transform positions each image around a circle
@keyframes autoRun creates the continuous rotation animation
Media queries ensure the slider looks good on all devices
